# CLOSURES
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lets-learn-javascript-closures-66feb44f6a44/
> Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables .(variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter.)
> In other words, the function defined in the closure ‘remembers’ the environment in which it was created.

+ 1. WHAT IS THE SCOPE
## Compiler Theory
avaScript engine performs many of the same steps, 
albeit in more sophisticated ways than we may commonly be aware, 
of any traditional language compiler:

* Tokenizing/Lexing
  > 
* Parsing
  > 
* Code-Generation

## Understanding Scope





> Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope 
>even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.
